You don't know what you're doing and neither does anyone else.

"10x developer" is less a statement about a person's productivity than their avoidance of unproductivity.
It does not imply a large numerator, rather it implies a small denominator.

Practice Typing. Not because you'll be able to type more code,
but because it reduces the impedence between your thoughts and their manifestation.
Typing skill removes hurdles.

Don't attend pointless meetings. They're a time sink, and worse, a distraction.
Pointless meetings increase your denominator.

Go home when you want to. Work when you want to.
9-5 hour accounting is for people who want to say
"I *technically* met the requirements", your hours of productivity are not this precise.

Always ask "what if we just didn't do this?"

Remove indirection between you and the client.
Often, these indirections have job descriptions containing the word "manager".

Launch your product on day 1.

Assume that every decision you make is wrong. Because it is.

Religious debates are communication failures. Rather than take sides,
understand why there are multiple sides to be taken.

Enlightenment hack: learn another paradigm.

Do not write code that assumes you know what you are doing when you do not.
In these situations, every hour spend writing code is an hour you'll later spend unwriting it.

The earlier your project, the more coupled your code should be,
don't incur the cost of abstraction when the cost exceeds the value.

3AM code is fine if you stick to your principles.

You don't have time to do it the wrong way.

Your typing speed is a massive bottleneck.

Learn your tools.
